# Research Paper Finder

A modern web application for discovering and exploring research papers from arXiv.org. Built with Next.js and TypeScript, this project was created through the power of vibe coding - a testament to how AI can help developers learn and build new things quickly!

## üöÄ The Vibe Coding Journey

This project was built without any prior knowledge of TypeScript or Next.js, demonstrating how modern AI tools can help developers:
- Learn new technologies on the fly
- Build complex applications through natural conversation
- Bridge the gap between idea and implementation
- Create production-ready code while learning
